# dotfiles

This is a typical dotfiles folder for the various configurations that I do in my installations. This will include almost any special configs or ricing I do in any Linux installs but it will mainly focus on my Arch installs which utilize Hyprland, Kitty, Tmux, Zsh, and Neovim. 

## Usage
```shell
git clone git@gitlab.com:thadigus/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
chmod +x ./create_symlinks.sh
./create_symlinks.sh
```

## Support
Any support/questions or ideas can be addressed on the [Issues Page](https://gitlab.com/thadigus/dotfiles/-/issues).

## Contributing
This is mainly a repo for my personal configuration tracking and some examples I can give on my [blog](https://turnerservices.cloud/). I'm open to ideas and suggestions but this is mostly a repo I am providing publicly in case someone wants to see an example of something I've done.
